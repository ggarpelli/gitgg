# Gitgg: Simplified Git Branch Comparison

Tired of complex commands just to see the difference between file versions on other branches? **Gitgg** is your essential tool for a quick and intuitive file comparison experience, directly inside VS Code.

With just a couple of clicks, you can select one or more files and instantly diff them against any local branch in your repository.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **üîé Flexible File Comparison**: Instantly compare a single file or a selection of multiple files against any branch. The extension handles it all seamlessly.

-   **üå≥ "Working Tree" Awareness**: When comparing a file against its own branch, Gitgg intelligently detects uncommitted changes and labels your version as the `(Working Tree)`, so you always know what you're looking at.

-   **üöÄ Quick & Easy Access**: No need to leave your editor. Access the compare feature directly from the right-click context menu in the File Explorer or on the editor tab. For even faster access, use the `Shift + \` keyboard shortcut.

-   **‚ö° Optimized Multi-File Webview**: Custom Webview using `diff2html` to display all changes in a cohesive, visually appealing format.

## üé¨ Demo in Action
